Snk Shortcodes for WordPress

Snk Shortcodes has one of the most complete icons sets available on all of WordPress Plugins. Available families include: Linecons, FontAwesome, Steadysets, Entypo, Linearicons, typicons, Unycon, SimpleLineIcons & Themify.

Features
--------
* **Provide updates for plugins and themes.**    

  From the users perspective, the updates work just like they do with plugins and themes listed in the official WordPress.org directory.
* **Easy to set up.**

  Just upload the script directory to your server and drop a plugin or theme ZIP in the `packages` subdirectory. Now you have a working update API at `http://yourserver.com/wp-update-server/?action=get_metadata&slug=your-plugin`.

* **Minimal server requirements.**

  The server component requires PHP 5.3+ and the Zip extension. The client library only requires PHP 5.2 - same as the current version of WordPress.

* **License.**
